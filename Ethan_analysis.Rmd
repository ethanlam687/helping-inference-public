##### Statistical Tests Comparing Move Types Across Experiments

E2 players made significantly more useful moves than E1 players across all goal-types. 

For the "move" goal type, E2 players also made significantly more inconsequential moves than E1 players.

ttest_all <- long_tbl %>%
  # group and nested data by goal_type & move_type
  
  group_by(goal_type, move_type) %>%
  nest() %>%

  # run t-test on each nested chunk
  mutate(
    ttest_obj = map(data, ~ t.test(count ~ experiment, data = .x, var.equal = TRUE)),
    tidied    = map(ttest_obj, tidy)

    t_value = statistic,
